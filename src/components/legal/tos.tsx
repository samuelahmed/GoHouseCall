        disputes, arising out of or relating to the TOS, or the relationship
        between you and House Call, shall be filed within the courts having
        jurisdiction within the County of San Francisco, California or the U.S.
        District Court located in said state. You and House Call agree to submit
        to the jurisdiction of the courts as previously mentioned, and agree to

        WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY OF TERMS

      <p className="py-1 md:py-2">
        At any time, should House Call fail to exercise or enforce any right or
        provision of the TOS, such failure shall not constitute a waiver of such
        right or provision. If any provision of this TOS is found by a court of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
        that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&apos;
        intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of
        the TOS remain in full force and effect.
